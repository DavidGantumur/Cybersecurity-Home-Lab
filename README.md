# Cybersecurity-Home-Lab
This repository contains my personal home lab setup using Kali Linux in VirtualBox.  It includes screenshots of VM configuration, OS updates, and working security tools like Nmap, Wireshark, and Metasploit. The lab was built for practicing Linux commands, network scanning, and basic cybersecurity tasks.
